I am just ask AI searcher: "right configuration for development workplase with bun, astro, typescript, obsidian, cloudflare" for fun... 


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.24. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
